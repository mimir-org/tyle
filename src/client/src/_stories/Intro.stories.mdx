# Type library design system

> Currently in alpha

With this design system we want to establish reusable components and guidelines which will help its users contribute to the application in an effective manner.

## Get started
- Explore what the design system offers by clicking on any of the components in the sidebar to see how they look, and how to configure them.
  Each component page contains documentation on how to use it, and what properties it offers __(coming soon)__.

- Experiment
  - Adjust different properties, by clicking on the Canvas tab at the top of each component page.
  - Change the available properties under Knobs tab in the bottom panel.

-  Use them Once you've found the right component for your use case, click the Story tab to see the code implementation, or look at examples under Docs.
